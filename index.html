                    <p class="f-article pt-2 mb-0">
                        I sat in a narrow trench, covered with piles of wood, to serve as a bulwark. There is only a
                        small shield on the front for crawling in and out in an emergency. This pit is L-shaped. Inside,
                        it was dark and there was no air as wide as the outside atmosphere. There are many king crabs in
                        the woods. Near my feet are mounds of red ants piled up to make their living quarters. On the
                        other side of the shed, I saw bags of rice and some clothes, all piled up here and there. As my
                        mother was terrified of the shootings between the national army and the guerrillas of the Khmer
                        Rouge blood war alone, she kept throwing in as much as she could. Terrified, my hands are numb,
                        but the service is wrapped tightly in a krama, I do not know what it is. My head is all ground
                        when there is the sound of artillery Shaking, trembling, falling from three piles of wood like
                        raindrops. My father always sprinkled soil on my head, saying softly, "May the earth save my
                        children from all evil." Sweaty clothes, parents, siblings, brothers and sisters enter this room
                        together. Everyone was talking to each other in frightening whispers and their ears were
                        listening to the gun. Once heard from the north. Once heard from the west, then correspond
                        incessantly. I heard it from time to time, terrified, stabbed in the abdomen and chest. The
                        smell of earth, the smell of the body of each person in this pit, even though it was dark and I
                        could not see each other, but it made me know who I really was. The sound of gunfire was over
                        for a while, but no one in the security pit dared to leave. Every day, as always, I would hide
                        in this pit when there was a gun attack by a group of Cambodian warriors. In the long run, I do
                        not want to get out of this pit, I want to live in peace with a family, I want nothing but
                        peace. I was in the pit often. This seems to keep me warm, avoid fear and protect me in every
                        way. It was getting darker and darker, and the sound of wailing was heard again, instead of the
                        sound of gunfire, accompanied by the sound of dogs chasing from the northern end of the village
                        to the front of my house. I listened in silence, barely daring to breathe. My heart was pounding
                        and my chest was pounding like I was about to burst. My feelings are really scared, find nothing
                        comparable. My father spoke to me and those in the pit with concern. He told my mother and my
                        relatives and I, who were in the pit, not to leave until he returned. Then he crawled out of the
                        pit, crawling through the banana plant near the milk tree. Close to the barn to watch for the
                        arrival of this cry. His actions are like the emergencies of the previous days. He understood
                        everything clearly, so he came back and told me and the people in this pit to come out and pack
                        as soon as possible to leave the house in Krasang village all night. Residence in Chongkal
                        district according to their evacuation. I jumped out of the pit and hurried to get some things
                        and put them on the cart. My father brought oxen to cart. My mother with one hand, my brother
                        with one hand, holding a space lamp, walking in front of a cart, illuminating the road. The
                        people in the village called for a meeting in front of my house and drove away in the dark of
                        night. I looked at the house many times, but because the night was too dark, the cart drove away
                        until I could no longer see my house. My tears flowed unconsciously in the dark night, no one
                        saw or heard. His actions are like the emergencies of the previous days. He understood

                        Every day I cry in my heart, because I am very sad about this chronic war. I often ask
                        unanswered questions, asking myself countless times why there is a war? Why do they want to
                        attack others, even though others want to be like themselves? Does the nation's prosperity
                        really need to go to war to kill each other? What I want is not like this, I want to see the
                        life of the people, peace, a prosperous country, people know how to love each other, help each
                        other, be united as a brotherhood in this land of Sovannaphum.

                        War brings destruction, loss of property, loss of life. What people are always ambitious, not
                        satisfied, and everyone is always divided because of greed, but with their own power, endless
                        desires in this love cycle. At any given time, confrontation has never progressed through
                        violence. It hardens and shortens the life of the human race and causes disunity, affecting the
                        Khmer culture, traditions and customs, especially the loss of patriotic will in the name of
                        Khmer resin blood. Structures in villages, districts, pagodas, schools, hospitals across the
                        country were destroyed. The isolated people of the city and the countryside, who used to live
                        happily with their personal freedoms and enjoy their livelihood in this peaceful country, are
                        now homeless, wandering around at the behest of people like me. The chariot kept going, even
                        though it was getting dark in the middle of the night. I sat drowsily on the cart, even though
                        the dirt from the wheels of the cart came to water on my body, I do not seem to care that my big
                        problem, but what is my problem now is the life and future of I have to drift to where no one
                        knows and can not explain.

                        families and homes, quickly change into a homeless person for a short time, leaving their fields
                        and gardens floating around at night. Conspicuous. This is because the cause of the war that
                        arises from the desire for destructive power, but the nation itself is not afraid to pity the
                        lives of innocent people a bit.

                        This autumn, the weather at night is getting colder, I am shivering like a sparrow in the rain.
                        The smell of ripe rice wafted from the rice fields near the road from Krasaing village through
                        the north of Chhouk village to Khnar village, Kork Spean village and Preah Nokor village towards
                        Chong Kal district town. The wind is blowing tonight, the sound of dogs barking because the
                        owner is lost, the sound of stealing from the forest behind the herd of travel. This sound made
                        my heart ache even more. Cows walk, eat grass, and do not stop. Traveling all night until dawn,
                        I finally arrived in Chongkal.

                    <p class="f-article pt-2 mb-0">
                        Every morning, my father used to go to harvest rice in the south of Krasaing village with the
                        villagers who helped him harvest one by one, but this time he came to live in the pagoda of
                        Chong Kal district. The rest of my father, as well as all the villagers, was not filled and
                        harvested as before, but was left completely in Krasang village. Life as a farmer is nothing
                        happier than harvesting rice that is ripe across the fields. I used to get up early in the
                        morning to cook instead of my parents' hands and feet to wrap them up for them to go out to
                        harvest rice, so I was born and sat on the cart, refusing to leave. I am still not satisfied
                        with the evacuation activities. Feelings of confusion. It seems like a nightmare. Everywhere I
                        looked, I saw carts and people stopping at the pagoda. Everyone worries in their minds, can't
                        solve it.

                        I stayed in Chongkal district for one night and was evacuated by the mobile team leader to Trom
                        village, Srey Snom district, Siem Reap province, with the children in the village my age.
                        Withdrawal this time I went alone. As for my family, they were left to travel partly to Trom
                        village, Srey Snom district, Siem Reap province as well. But this time, they split up, taking
                        the children on separate trips, and the family traveling with the other party. My father handed
                        me a scarf and told me to take it with me and use it in case of an emergency. Do not throw it
                        away because it is your life. I reached for the gift and hugged it with excitement. I bowed down
                        in tears, bowed my head to say goodbye to my father, accompanied by gratitude to my benefactors.
                        At the same time, the leader of the mobile team and a group of young people arrived and escorted
                        us about thirty people to wait for the water elephant ride. Transport sand for construction from
                        Kork Sramor village to Kralanh district. After a while, three cars came and we had to split into
                        three groups and get in that car. The water elephant swam as fast as its name implies. The car
                        leads to Ochik Bridge, a bridge on the border of two provinces, Siem Reap and Oddar Meanchey.

                        stopped and did not move forward immediately. The sound of screaming like a sparrow breaking the
                        nest into my eyes, I can not find anything, my hand one hand wrapped around the other hand,
                        searching for friends riding together on the sand dunes, scrambling to find all the numbers. Oh!

                        with tears in my eyes. I could clearly see with my own eyes that it was a small, thick print,
                        and that there was a bullet hole, but it did not reflect. Oh! My life, you have saved me from
                        death and life, have escaped this evil, and without you, my body would have been reflected by
                        this explosive metal. My body, my fresh blood, it will fall in line with this beautiful earth in

                        dams in Trapeang Sreng. And at Ang Trapeang Thmor as well. No matter where you are, no matter

                        southern end of the village to refresh themselves in the evening. By the way, our dinner is no

                        when necessary to put rice and food as needed. This mobile group eats only at night, sometimes
                        only potatoes, sometimes only rice, no soup, sometimes only porridge… and sometimes bitter or
                        raw…. Also, I do not complain, I can only swallow my stomach and live on.

                        elderly. A group of children were asked to walk around collecting cow dung to dig compost. Youth
                        groups are organized into mobile groups to close the fields or harvest rice. The middle age
                        group is assigned to lead and work in each team. As for the elderly, they stay at home to watch
                        the children of the team who are sent to harvest rice in the light…, where they each take care
                        of three or five small children. As for the food, all the groups do not require anyone to cook
                        or cook themselves, they have a chef to manage this work. As soon as it was time for breakfast,
                        lunch, and dinner, I heard the bells ringing to signal to the entire team to line up for the

                        be drifting in the middle of the day and night like that. Is this my work from the past or did
                        it cause my life to face all these things? Day and night there is no opportunity to talk and
                        live with a warm family. No, it is not my bad result, because the people of one village, one
                        country is also sad about this. Now, even during the festival season, no one dares to follow the
                        tradition, because this regime has closed all the freedoms of the people so that no one can
                        worry about this festival. On the other hand, there are no monks in the pagoda because they have
                        already decapitated the monks. Oh! Cambodia, you are experiencing like a slogan, "Culture

                        home like this, they run to hug and cry in front of us, as if to say that they miss They are
                        very worried, they are very miserable…. I knelt down with both hands clasped under their chests,
                        lovingly embracing them. My uncontrollable tears flowed with excitement at their intimacy and
                        sincerity. Although animals, but they seem to be a family member, so I say that one of them,
                        whether they understand or not, means that from now on you will live happily with me and my
                        family. Let us stop leaving you and as long as our lives are not dissolved, you will live
                        happily in my family circle. In particular, this nation will gradually regain peace.
